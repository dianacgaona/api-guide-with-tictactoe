### PLEASE:
1. Do a git pull before choosing a todo item
2. Put your initials by the todo item you're working on so others can select from the remaining todo items when they do a git pull
3. Do a git push so the todo.md is updated for everyone to see when they do their git pull
4. create a branch to work on the todo item
